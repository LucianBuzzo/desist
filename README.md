# Desist

Tired of nosey developers constantly checking if your site is responsive by 
resizing your browser window over and over again?

Well, with **Desist** this is a thing of the past! 

**Desist** will display a friendly message when the browser is resized too
frequently.

Simply load desist.js onto your webpage to alleviate this problem.

```
    <script src="desist.js"></script>
```
